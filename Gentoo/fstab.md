## Notes:
### Options.
`autodefrag` Specific to btrfs. Enable automatic file defragmentation. When enabled, small random writes into files (in a range of tens of kilobytes, currently itâ€™s 64K) are detected and queued up for the defragmentation process. Not well suited for large database workloads.
[Why autodefrag should still be enabled on SSDs.](https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-btrfs/msg31028.html)
`defaults` Use default options: rw, suid, dev, exec, auto, nouser, and async.
`noauto` Does not automatically mount at boot. Can still be mounted via the `mount -a` command.
`compress=lzo` Specific to btrfs. (See 'compression' below.)
`sw` Specific to swap.

## Compression.
### What are the differences between compression methods?
There's a speed/ratio trade-off:
    ZLIB -- slower, higher compression ratio (uses zlib level 3 setting, you can see the zlib level difference between 1 and 6 in zlib sources).
    LZO -- faster compression and decompression than zlib, worse compression ratio, designed to be fast
    ZSTD -- (since v4.14) compression comparable to zlib with higher compression/decompression speeds and different ratio levels (details) 
The differences depend on the actual data set and cannot be expressed by a single number or recommendation. Do your own benchmarks. LZO seems to give satisfying results for general use.
